THEORY:

Privilege Escalation means leveraging privileges of another user by abusing weaknesses in system.
Gaining access to different accounts can be as simple as finding credentials in text files or spreadsheets left unsecured by some careless user.

Possible Weaknesses in Windows system:
	- Misconfigurations on Windows services or scheduled tasks
	- Excessive privileges assigned to our account
	- Vulnerable software
	- Missing Windows security patches

WINDOWS USERS: 

1. Administrators: These users have the most privileges. They can change any system configuration parameter and access any file in the system.

2. Standard Users: These users can access the computer but only perform limited tasks. Typically these users can not make permanent or essential changes to the system and 
		   are limited to their files.

	User with administrative privileges will be part of the Administrators group
	Standard users are part of the Users group.


BUILT-IN ACCOUNTS used by OS:

1. SYSTEM/LocalSystem: An account used by the OS to perform internal tasks. It has full access to all files and resources available on the host with even higher privileges than administrators.

2. Local Service: Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use anonymous connections over the network.

3. Network Service: Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use the computer credentials to authenticate through the network.

These accounts are created and managed by Windows, and can't be used as other regular accounts normally.
