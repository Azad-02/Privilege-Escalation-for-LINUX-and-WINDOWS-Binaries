1. UNPATCHED SOFTWARE

Software installed on the target system can present various privilege escalation opportunities. As with drivers, organisations and users may not update
them as often as they update the operating system. You can use the 'wmic' tool to list software installed on the target system and its versions. The command below will dump information it can gather on installed software (it might take around a minute to finish):

	wmic product get name,version,vendor

Remember that the wmic product command may not return all installed programs. Depending on how some of the programs were installed, they might not get 
listed here. 
It is always worth checking desktop shortcuts, available services or generally any trace that indicates the existence of additional software that might 
be vulnerable.

Once we have gathered product version information, we can always search for existing exploits on the installed software online on sites like 'exploit-
db', 'packet storm/ or plain old 'Google', amongst many others.
