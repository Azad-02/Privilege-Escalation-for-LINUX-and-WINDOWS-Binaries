Sometimes users make backups of important files but fail to secure them with the correct permissions.

Look for hidden files & directories in the system root:
> ls -la /

Note that there appears to be a hidden directory called .ssh. View the contents of the directory:
> ls -l /.ssh

Note that there is a world-readable file called root_key. Further inspection of this file should indicate it is a private SSH key. The name of the 
file suggests it is for the root user.

Copy the key over to your Kali box (it's easier to just view the contents of the root_key file and copy/paste the key) and give it the correct 
permissions, otherwise your SSH client will refuse to use it:
> chmod 600 root_key

Use the key to login to the Debian VM as the root account (note that due to the age of the box, some additional settings are required when using SSH):
> ssh -i root_key -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa root@10.10.6.63
