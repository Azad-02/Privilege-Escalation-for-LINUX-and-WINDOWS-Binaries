List the programs which sudo allows your user to run:
> sudo -l

Visit GTFOBins (https://gtfobins.github.io) and search for some of the program names. If the program is listed with "sudo" as a function, you can use it to elevate privileges, usually via an escape sequence.

Choose a program from the list and try to gain a root shell, using the instructions from GTFOBins.

For an extra challenge, try to gain a root shell using all the programs on the list!
