SUID(Set-user Identification) and SGID(Set-group identification) are two special permissions that can be set on executable files, and These 
permissions allow the file being executed to be executed with the privileges of the owner or the group. SUID/SGID files can have vulnerabilities 
that can be exploited to gain root shell.

Find all the SUID/SGID executables on the Debian VM:
> find / -type f -a \( -perm -u+s -o -perm -g+s \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2> /dev/null

Try to find a known exploit for the results found on executing above command. Exploit-DB, Google, and GitHub are good places to search!

A local privilege escalation exploit matching this version should be available.

Run the exploit script to gain a root shell:
> /home/user/tools/suid/exim/cve-2016-1531.sh
